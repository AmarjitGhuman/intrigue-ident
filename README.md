Ident is the app fingerprinting library used within Intrigue Core. It uses Headless Chrome and Selenium to drive a browser, as well as core Ruby libraries to make requests. Identification should take around 10 seconds if using browser checks, faster if not.

Getting started on OSX:
=======================
1) [Install brew](https://brew.sh/) (if you don't already have it)

2)  Then install chromedriver via a brew cask: https://www.kenst.com/2015/03/installing-chromedriver-on-mac-osx/: 

```
$ brew cask install chromedriver
```

2.1) Alias chrome so it can be started via chromedriver (unsure if this is needed)

```
alias chrome="/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome"
```

3) Install ruby [preferrably using rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#installation)

4) Install bundler ```gem install bundler```

5) Clone the ident repository ```git clone https://github.com/intrigueio/intrigue-ident.git```

6) Install the ident gem dependencies

```bundle install```

7) Now use the check utility to test!

Troubleshooting:
================

If you hit something like the following: 
```Selenium::WebDriver::Error::SessionNotCreatedError: session not created: Chrome version must be between 70 and 73
  (Driver info: chromedriver=73.0.3683.68 (47787ec04b6e38e22703e856e101e840b65afe72),platform=Mac OS X 10.14.1 x86_64)
  /Users/jcran/.rbenv/versions/2.5.1/lib/ruby/gems/2.5.0/gems/selenium-webdriver-3.142.2/lib/selenium/webdriver/remote/response.rb:72:in `assert_ok'
 ```

It's likely that you need to update chromedriver. Do that by running the command: 
```$ brew cask reinstall chromedriver```
